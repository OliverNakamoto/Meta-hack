# ü§ñ Problem Areas

## Theme One: Scientific Innovation

Llama‚Äôs ability to be hosted on-prem makes it an ideal model for analyzing potentially sensitive or proprietary datasets, as seen in medicine, biology, agriculture, energy, astronomy, or other natural sciences. Further, many sciences require edge research and field work, where connectivity is spotty. How can Llama be used to enhance scientific discovery, data processing, or delivering applications to scientists or downstream users?

### **Inspiration:**
- [CurePharma AI](https://reskilll.com/hack/aihack/projects): A healthcare solution providing personalized medication information in regional languages, addressing accessibility issues in rural and literacy-challenged areas. It integrates with WhatsApp for easy prescription scanning, translation, and medicine ordering.
- [Aida](https://www.loom.com/share/54d646b1aed44da89111d2ef3dee7137): Classifying real-time satellite data to coordinate humanitarian responses around the world.
- [GreenField Verdant](https://lablab.ai/event/hackathon-llama-impact-pan-latam-es/llama-llauchas/greenfield-verdant): Provides an interactive dashboard with key information, predictions, and diagnostic tools to help farmers protect their crops and maximize land potential. The app features advanced technologies, including disease diagnosis, NASA data maps, and an intelligent assistant, to support informed decision-making and boost agricultural productivity.
- [Gripmind](https://x.com/_fracapuano/status/1858102728691458554): Mind-controlled robotic arm combining traditional RL and Llama‚Äôs decision-making to accomplish tasks. 2nd place at the Llama Impact Hackathon in London.

## Theme Two: Language

Being open-source, Llama can be fine-tuned on any language for translation, chat, form completion, or other use cases. How can you use Llama to deploy, tune, or build applications that preserve, access, or advance Nordic languages?

### **Inspiration:**
- [Traversal AI](https://traversaal.ai/): Fine-tuned instances of Llama on low-resource languages around the world. Winner of the Meta Llama APAC accelerator in Singapore.
- [Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUsvpXUQc0): End-to-end, Llama-powered triaging system for hospitals. Doctors can rapidly understand problems in any language, prioritize patients, and translate on the fly. Winner of the Llama Impact Hackathon in London.
- [Taichiwin Translate](https://lablab.ai/event/hackathon-llama-impact-pan-latam-es/tachiwin/tachiwin-indigenous-languages-translator): Translator for Mexico's indigenous languages, aiming to provide speakers with equal access to technology and promote linguistic and cultural preservation. The project created an LLM for Tutunak√∫, a Mexican indigenous language, and is developing a translation app to support offline and online use.
- [Bineric.AI](http://Bineric.AI): Created NorskGPT, an AI assistant to be fine-tuned and deployed for use in Norwegian.
