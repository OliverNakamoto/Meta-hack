Finalists from Meta hackathon in London, slight different Problem Area (innovative solutions for UK Government's core missions) but might be useful:

First Place – Guardian
An AI-powered triage assistant to support frontline NHS staff. Built on Llama 3.2, Guardian transforms A&E departments through intelligent patient intake, real-time risk assessment, and Atlas – a breakthrough clinical AI agent that provides a second pair of eyes to doctors and nurses. It will also support patients across multiple languages, helping them communicate their symptoms better.

Second Place – Gripmind
A solution that makes robotics in assisted living more useful, scalable, and affordable. An open-source project combining the Llama 3.2 Vision model, which processes signals from the brain, voice, or images to control a robotic arm. This solution is envisioned to help support people with mobility issues.

Third Place – Pharmallama
An on-device app that allows patients to engage with their pharmacist to discuss potential side effects, understand necessary medications, and centralize patient records to identify conflicting prescriptions. This is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues or who are unable to access a local pharmacy.

ClimaticAI
"Heat the person, not the home"—save up to a third on energy bills. Their AI-powered concept works with smart devices, infrared-controlled appliances, and IoT sensors to optimize energy use based on presence, cost, and savings goals. Affordable, open-source, and easy to use—comfort and efficiency, simplified.

Team WinAmp
An intelligent companion app for sustainable eating that makes the healthy choice the easy choice by comparing supermarket offers on healthy food. It uses Llama to create highly personalized meal plans and habit-forming coaching, making nutrition guidance accessible at scale.

The GoodPath
A platform that creates a roadmap into a socially impactful career—featuring culturally relevant explanations, visual diagrams, and translations into underserved regional dialects. It also includes a tutor function that guides users on everything from giving strong interview answers to flashcard-based exam preparation.

There is a large (50%) emphasize on the demo, meaning we need to have something that runs and looks good. It does not have to be pretty code but has to work and show our idea and that it could work. I think something in the line of using Llama models in some agentic fashion is quite possibly to set up in 24 hrs and then also making the application (local server) look good.
- oliver just some mild brainstorming, first thoughts
